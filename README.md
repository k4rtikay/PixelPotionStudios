## About the Project

This project is an intranet homepage designed for the fictional indie game company, "Pixel Potion Studios." The goal was to create a digital workspace that is both functional and bursting with personality fit for a small indie dev company.

The dashboard features two distinct themes: a creative, pixel-art light mode that pays homage to classic 16-bit video games and a dark mode for based on the elements of the light mode to make it a seamless user experience. All components are built from scratch, focusing on clean code, accessibility, and a polished user experience with subtle, thematic animations.
